For analog signals, most of the processing operations are performed in the time domain, on the other side, for discrete-time signals the time and frequency domain operations are employed.

# Simple Time-Domain Operations

There are three basic time-domain signal processing operations:

  1. Scaling : The multiplication of the signal by a positive/negative constant. For analog signals, this operation is called _amplification_ if the multiplier is greater than one, otherwise is called _attenuation_. More formally, if $ x(t) $ is the analog signal, the scaling operation generates a $ y(t) = \alpha x(t) $.
  2. Delay : Generates a replica signal that is delayed in respect to the original.
  3. Addition
