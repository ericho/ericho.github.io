This is the first post, I'm still testing the features of jekyll at this point.
Testing some inline code ``int x = 0;``

And adding some block code

```c
// This is some inline code
for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
	// do something...
}
```

```go
func f1(s string) (output, err) {
	output = s
	err = nil
}
```

```rust
let mut a = 0;
println!("Printing something");
```

```bash
echo -e "I'm a bash command"
```
