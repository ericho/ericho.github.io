---

I'm an Electronics Instrumentation Engineer (always had problems to correctly translate the actual name) who is fall in love with software development. I like to learn about software development and new programming languages. I've been a GNU/Linux user circa 2002 and open source enthusiast.

Currently I work at Intel in Guadalajara Mexico as a Edge Cloud Software Engineer. I work in the [StarlingX project](https://www.starlingx.io/). Before this I gather some experience on software development for administrative tools in High Performence Computing environments and development and validation on GNU/Linux device drivers.

I like photography, see [my Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/elerich0/), travel, read, learn about music and coffee hobbyist.
